    "# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, `\"ace\"` is a subsequence of `\"abcde\"` while `\"aec\"` is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no common subsequence, return $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`\n",
    "- `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`\n",
    "- The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.\n"
